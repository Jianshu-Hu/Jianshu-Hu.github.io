This is the personal webpage for Jianshu Hu!

I am currently a PhD student in SJTU-UM Joint Institute, SJTU. I am working on Deep Reinforcement Learning and Robotics, supervised by Professor Yutong Ban and Professor Paul Weng. Before this, I obtained my master degree in University of Pennsylvania, supervised by Professor Michael Posa. I am thrilled to build intelligent agents which can solve complex robotics tasks powered by Computer Vision and Deep Reinforcement Learning. To achieve this, I am designing sample-efficient DRL algorithms by leveraging data augmentation, invariance/equivariance.
